	  <p>My name is Nikki Mueller. I am currently in the Software and Mobile Developer programs. I was born and raised in 
	  Eau Claire, which is where I still reside with my family. I have two sons, who are 12 and 9 years old. My husband 
	  owns a motorsports shop in Eau Claire. I occasionally help out there with book work or whatever else he needs help 
	  with. As for hobbies, we are a family of animal lovers and have 10 free range chickens, 2 dogs, and 2 cats that keep 
	  us busy. I also love playing volleyball, which we do at least once per week. </p>
